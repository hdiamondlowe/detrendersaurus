# detrendersaurus

******** This is nowhere near ready for public release, it is mostly a reference for me slash anyone who wants to get an idea of how I got my results ********

The detrendersaurus helps you detrend data from a cube into usable lightcurves.

It takes the outputs from mosasaurus (reading multi-object spectrograph raw data) as an input.

Eventually you should be able to go straight from mosasaurus to detrendersaurus by simply creating one new input file but we're not quite there yet...

You can get started with this super rough version of detrendersaurus by 

    1. downloading it 

    2. emailing me for an example data cube (it's large and I haven't bothered hosting it anywhere)
    
    3. looking over the files in the example directory
    
Then, when you're ready, run detrend.py from within the examples directory.
