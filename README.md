# detrendersaurus

The detrendersaurus helps you detrend data from a cube into usable lightcurves.

It takes the outputs from mosasaurus (reading multi-object spectrograph raw data) as an input.

Eventually you should be able to go straight from mosasaurus to detrendersaurus by simply creating one new input file but we're not quite there yet...
